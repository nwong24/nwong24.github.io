## Initial frustrations
When I first started using ESLint for this class, I found them annoying and more of something that hindered more than it helped. Code that I was usually able to get running would show red bars, warning me that I was making a mistake. It would take a lot of time and research to understand why they were appearing and what they were trying to get me to do. This was a problem that I hadn't dealt with before. After all, I had only written code for my own eyes to see and certaintly not code that I would be revisiting in more than a couple of weeks.

## A new perspective
Now, I have gained a newfound appreciation for coding standards and the purpose they serve. Spending time looking over those errors has taught me better ways to write certain pieces of code. In addition, if I was working on a team with multiple people, I would definitely find it frustrating if I was trying to work on someone else's code (or my code from ages ago) and it wasn't neat and didn't look uniform to the rest. Coding standards definitely help improve the speed and efficiency of both you and your team if you learn to work with them and don't try to fight the linter.

## Personal growth
Rather than treating the linter as my enemy, I've learned to treat it as a teacher trying to correct my mistakes. Every time it throws me an error that I'm not sure how to fix is an opportunity for me to learn and grow as a software engineer. It has inspired me to write cleaner and more maintainable code. I will be sure to always check my code with ESLint from now on.
